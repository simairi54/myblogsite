LAMP
=====
So when it comes to LAMP we are talking about { Linux, Apache, MySql & PHP }
LAMP is an open source Web development platform that uses Linux as the operating system, Apache as the Web
server, MySQL as the relational database management system and PHP as the object-oriented scripting language.
Because the platform has four layers, LAMP is sometimes referred to as a LAMP stack. Stacks can be built on different
operating systems.
